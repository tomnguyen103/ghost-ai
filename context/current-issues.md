fix the drag and drop functionality. Check `/context/screenshots/image2.png` for the incorrect shape display

Read the current canvas component code in `components/editor`

Issues to look for and document:

DRAG AND DROP ISSUES:

 - Canvas nodes from the node panel cannot be dragged and dropped onto the canvas. Investigate and fix the full drag-and-drop pipeline:
  - Confirm that draggable nodes in the node panel have the correct draggable attribute and onDragStart handler that sets the node type in dataTransfer
  - Confirm that the canvas has onDragOver (with preventDefault to allow dropping) and onDrop handlers wired up correctly
  - Ensure the drop handler reads the node type from dataTransfer, calculates the correct canvas coordinates accounting for pan offset and zoom scale, and creates a new node at the dropped position
  - Check that no parent element is intercepting or blocking the drag events before they reach the canvas

Nodes can be dragged from the node panel and dropped onto the canvas correctly
